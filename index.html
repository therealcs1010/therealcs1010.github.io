                        ​This app was created to assist users who live in relatively unsafe locations. Users can send updates to their friends as well as quickly inform authorities if they feel that they are in danger. This android application was coded in Kotlin and is an MVP.

                                    ​As the taekwondo captain, I initiated a collaboration with the service-learning club to get food donation from the student population to give to the needy residents. This was done over a period of 2 weeks, where I oversaw the manpower allocation, as
                                    well as account for the food collected before sending it to the residents. We also did spring cleaning for some of the residents who needed help.

                                    be an easily available service to well off families, it is important to provide the same services to families who are unable to afford it.

                                    or injured animals. Hence, it is important for us to nurse them before releasing them.

                                    of us born in Singapore are privileged enough to be educated, many people do not have this opportunity, and it is imperative for us to provide assistance to the less fortunate.

                                    childhood could possibly pave their future. It is essential to build up a reading habit in them and pique their curiousity in books to develop their critical thinking skills.
