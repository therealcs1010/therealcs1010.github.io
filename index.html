                        Raspberry Pi and the computer. For the object detection, we channeled data from the LiDAR to the Arduino Board to the RPi before
                            sending it to the laptop for us to run Hector Slam.

                        ​This android application was coded in java and the intention is to allow users to find space to eat with relative ease. The main locations I have chosen are food courts in Temasek Polytechnic, and it 
                        retrieves information such as the number of seats available, as well as a QR code function for when you are at the seat.

                        they are in danger. This android application was coded in Kotlin and is an MVP.

                                 This was done over a period of 2 weeks, where I oversaw the manpower allocation, as well as account for the food collected before sending it to the residents. We also
                                  did spring cleaning for some of the residents who needed help.

                                ​I worked with a group of volunteers to provide tuition services to needy children who were taking PSLE. I was originally there as a temporary teacher but committed to it for 
                                2 years as I enjoyed interacting with the children. While tuition services might be an easily available service to well off families, it is important to provide the same services to 
                                families who are unable to afford it.

                                they must be kept at the shelter there. Most of these are endangered species or injured animals. Hence, it is important for us to nurse them before releasing them.

                                    ​​I went overseas to Bali for 2 weeks on a program by International Volunteer HQ to teach the less fortunate children there. The lessons were mainly focused on English, and it also 
                                    provided plenty of opportunities to interact with the locals. While most of us born in Singapore are privileged enough to be educated, many people do not have this opportunity, and it is 
                                    imperative for us to provide assistance to the less fortunate.

                                    at a young age and the hobbies they pick up during childhood could possibly pave their future. It is essential to build up a reading habit in them and pique their curiousity in books to develop their
                                    critical thinking skills.
